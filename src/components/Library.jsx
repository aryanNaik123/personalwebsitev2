        <Quote
          text="“In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject
            matter area) who didn't read all the time—none. Zero. You'd be
            amazed at how much Warren reads—and how much I read. My children
            laugh at me. They think I'm a book with a couple of legs sticking
            out.”"

        it.”"

        <Quote
          text="“If you are depressed you are living in the past.
        If you are anxious you are living in the future.
        If you are at peace you are living in the present.”

        <Quote text="“Only the paranoid survive.“" author="Andy Grove" />
        <Quote
          text="“When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world-try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. But life-that's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact. And that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it-you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.“"
          author="Steve Jobs"

        <Quote
          text="“Most people never pick up the phone. Most people never call and ask. And that's what separates sometimes the people who do things from those who just dream about them. You gotta act. You gotta be willing to fail. You gotta be willing to crash a burn. With people on the phone or starting a company, if you're afraid you'll fail, you won't get very far.”"

        <Quote
          text="“Get action. Do things; be sane; don't fritter away your time; create, act, take a place wherever you are and be somebody; get action.”"
          author="Theodore Roosevelt"
        />
        <Quote
          text="“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”"
